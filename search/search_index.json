GCP offers a service called \"budgets\", which can send mails or publish to a Pub/Sub topic once a defined threshold is reached. This mechanism is used to trigger a Cloud Function that will disable the project\u00b4s billing account. </p> <p>Disclamer: Disabling billing on a project may result in data loss. The account can be manually reactivated but Google does not guarantee that all services remain in place.  -- cf.
